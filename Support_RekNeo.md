## Getting Started: Granting Permissions on macOS

For Rek Neo to work correctly, you need to grant a few permissions in your Mac's System Settings. The app will usually prompt you the first time, but if you accidentally deny a permission, you can enable it manually.

### How to Manually Grant Permissions:
Open System Settings on your Mac.
Go to **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar.
From here, you'll enable each required permission:

**Screen Recording:**
Find Screen & System Audio Recording in the list.
Find Rek Neo and turn the switch ON.

**Camera:**
Find Camera in the list.
Find Rek Neo and turn the switch ON.

**Microphone:**
Find Microphone in the list.
Find Rek Neo and turn the switch ON.

**Accessibility (for Keystrokes):**
This is essential for the keystroke display feature.
Find Accessibility in the list.
Find Rek Neo and turn the switch ON.

**Note:** macOS requires this permission to detect keystrokes for display purposes. We **never** log or store what you type.

**Important:** After enabling a permission, macOS may require you to quit and **restart Rek Neo** for the change to take effect.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### Where are my videos saved?
Your videos are saved directly to the folder you choose when the save dialog appears after you stop recording. By default, this is usually your **"Movies"** folder.

### Can I record without the camera or microphone?
Absolutely! All features are optional. You can configure what you want to record before you start.
