# Privacy Policy for Rek Neo

Last Updated: [Date]
Your privacy is our absolute priority. This policy outlines our principles regarding data and privacy for the Rek Neo application.

## Our Zero-Data Philosophy
We have a simple and strict privacy promise:
We do not collect any data.
We do not store any data.
We do not transmit any data.
We do not sell any data.
Rek Neo is designed to work entirely on your device. The videos you create are saved directly to your local storage. At no point do they pass through our servers or are they accessed by us. We have no way of knowing who you are or how you use the application.


## Required System Permissions
To function as intended, Rek Neo requires you to grant certain system permissions. These permissions are used only for the core functionality of the app and are never used to collect or monitor your activity.
- Screen Recording: This permission is necessary to capture the contents of your screen when you start a recording. The data is processed locally and saved directly into your video file.
- Microphone: This permission is required to capture audio from your built-in microphone or any other selected audio source to include in your video.
- Camera: This permission is needed to access your camera feed and display it in the movable window within your recording.
- Accessibility (Input Monitoring): This permission is strictly required for one feature: displaying your keystrokes on screen during a recording. It is not used to log, store, or transmit your keyboard input. It only visually represents the keys you press for the benefit of your video's viewers.

You are in full control of these permissions and can enable or disable them at any time through your macOS System Settings.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.
